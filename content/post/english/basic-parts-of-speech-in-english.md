A basic knowledge of the main parts of speech is the first step to grasping grammar and punctuation.This is very basic but often being used wrongly.

## Nouns
Nouns name people, places, things, or ideas.

Example:
My brother had a stressful day at work.

## Pronouns
Pronouns stand in for nouns.

Example: I stopped by my friend’s house, but she wasn’t home.

## Conjunctions
Conjunctions join two or more words or phrases.

Examples: I would join you for drinks and dinner, but I have other plans tonight.

## Verb
Verbs complete actions or show states of being.

Example: When I was in college, I studied in Europe.

## Adjectives
Adjectives are words that describe or modify other words.

Example: I like to read at cozy coffee shops on rainy days.

## Adverb
Adverbs describe verbs — specifically, how a verb is being done.

Examples: I emailed my client, and he quickly responded.

## Articles
Articles (a, an, the) specify which noun you’re talking about (and if the noun is general or specific in its reference).

Example: The software had a bug in it.

## Preposition
Prepositions show a relationship between a noun/pronoun and another word.

Example: My co-workers and I often eat lunch in the break room, where we talk about our plans for the day.
