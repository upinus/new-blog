In three of theme, HTML5Up is a collection of free and handsome template, which is ready for you to adding customization and deploy on your need.
To be honest, we were pretty surprised by its quality (and quantity). Actually, you don't need to purchase commercial themes and templates once you've known this site.

Along with that Pixelarity is a commercial market side, they offer premium templates compared to HTML5Up at very affordable prices. You could check it out yourself.

The most amazing one is Carrd, A static site builder which allows you to deploy websites with handsome templates in 5-10 minutes, you could also download the sites, adding customization, inserting analytics tools ,etc. And its price is very crazy, starts from $9 a year (A YEAR).

With these tools, I believe building static sites is now much easier without sacrificing your freedom on customization.
